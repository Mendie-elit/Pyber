Per the analysis described below there appears to be opportunity in Suburban markets to make money as a ride sharing driver.   To reach this conclusion we looked at the fare, rides, and drivers per city serving Urban, Suburban and Rural markets.  While Urban cities represents 63% of total fare revenue these fares are shared among 87% of the total drivers, resulting in a lower fare per ride.   The Suburban and Rural markets represent 31% and 7% of total fare revenue, respectively, however only 13% and 1% of the total drivers service these markets.  As displayed in the bubble chart included in this report the Average Fare per City for Suburban drivers exceeds that of Urban drivers while the Number of Rides in the Suburban market is only slightly less than the Urban market.  While the Average Fare per City in the Rural market is highest there are not enough rides to make as much total revenue as a Suburban driver.
